# DarkTale-Console-Game-Project

**DarkTale** is a Python-based console RPG featuring turn-based combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The game emphasizes story-driven gameplay with impactful choices, where players navigate through various areas, face challenges, and uncover a deep narrative. The game is still in progress and will be updated as soon as time permits.

## Final Project for Programming

This project serves as my **final project** for my **Programming** subject. Due to time constraints from other assignments and exams, the game may contain some bugs and incomplete features. I had to rush the development to meet the deadline. I plan to update and fix any issues in the future if time allows.

## Installation

1. Ensure **Python 3.6+** is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install keyboard
   ```
3. If you encounter issues with character display, ensure your terminal supports UTF-8 encoding.

## Running the Game

1. Navigate to the folder containing the game files.
2. Run the game with:
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```

Replace `game.py` with the actual filename of the main script.

## Dependencies

- `keyboard`: For handling keyboard inputs.
